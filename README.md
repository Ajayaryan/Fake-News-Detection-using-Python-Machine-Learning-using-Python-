Fake News is a spread of disinformation and hoaxes through any news platform. The imminent threat of such a widespread misinformation is 
obvious and hence we have looked into ways in which such Fake News can be identified with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Fake News 
Detection and analysis is an open challenge in AI!

The main question is what exactly constitutes Fake News?
Types of Fake News identified:
Political Fake News:
The statement and justification approach is used.The statement is a direct quote from a public personality. The justification is the context or 
background information for the statement. Justification is important as the statement on its own doesnâ€™t imply anything in regard to it being False or True.
Clickbait:
Another source of Fake News is a click bait scenario. Where the headline has no relation with the actual content and is just used to spike reader
interest.
Fake News Articles:
Some fake articles have relatively frequent use of terms seemingly intended to inspire outrage and the present writing skill in such articles is 
generally considerably lesser than in standard news.
